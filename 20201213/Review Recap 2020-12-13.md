## Picture improvement / enlargement

### Links:
* Affinity Photo tutorial (thanks Michael Stapfer)

With a comparison of the two programs mentioned (did try myself yet)

* [Imglarger](imglarger.com) (web interface, cloud-based) - just created an account to try it

(Wanted to try on an enlarged version, too, but no conversion left for today on my free account)

The first version wins on hair, but I would hand it to remind on face (especially the eyes) and ear rings …

Both are limited in the picture size, though (even when paid for)

##Stereo images

![](res/Stereo with help.jpg)

Hope you can see the stereogram for the 3D effect - here is a page listing many methods to approach it: https://www.hidden-3d.com/how_to_view_stereogram.php In any way I recommend seeing it on black background.

Caveat: unfortunately, it does require *binocular vision* to see the 3D effect from the two images (beyond what is deducible from a single one). 

### Random stereograms


##Panoramic images

Just for reference a link to my London panorama at reduced height (500 pixels as imposed by the site, the original is ~42000×5200 pixels):

And the resolution comparison I showed

## Tele test

Since I already prepared it, I’ll throw this in, too:

## Great conjunction

This s the link I stumbled upon last weekend - there are many more, it seems, but this was quite thorough and I like it being from a physics department ...

Have yet to see a clear night sky since, though, …
